        <h3>What is SEO ?</h3>
        <p>
          SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of enhancing a
          website's visibility and ranking on search engines through techniques
          like keyword optimization, content improvement, and link building. Its
          goal is to attract more organic traffic, increasing a site's chances
          of being found by users searching for relevant information or
          products.

        <h3 id="MinifyJS">Minify JavaScript for Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Using
          <a href="https://www.uglifyjs.net">https://www.uglifyjs.net/</a> for
          SEO offers several benefits. Minifying JavaScript reduces file size,
          leading to faster page load times and improved user experience.
          Faster-loading pages are favored by search engines, potentially
          boosting SEO rankings. Smaller JavaScript files also reduce bandwidth
          usage, benefitting users on mobile devices or with limited internet
          connections. Minified files can be cached efficiently, further
          improving subsequent visits. Search engine crawlers parse minified
          code more quickly, aiding accurate indexing. Mobile-friendliness is
          enhanced, which is crucial for higher rankings in mobile search
          results. A positive user experience may increase conversions. However,
          ensure thorough testing post-minification to avoid unintended issues.

          Meta description is an HTML meta tag providing a concise summary of
          webpage content, crucial for SEO. It appears in search results, so
          keeping it around 150-160 characters ensures full display. Crafting
          engaging and keyword-rich descriptions can improve click-through rates
          and SEO performance. Effective meta descriptions help search engines
          understand content and entice users to click, leading to better
          rankings and increased organic traffic.

        <h3 id="seoRobotsTXT">Enhancing SEO with Robots.txt</h3>
        <p>
          Robots.txt can aid SEO by guiding search engine crawlers' access to
          web content. It controls which pages to crawl or avoid, ensuring
          relevant and valuable content gets indexed. This optimizes the
          website's indexation, avoiding duplicate content issues and conserving
          crawl budget. By disallowing sensitive areas, it protects private
          content from public access and indexing. Strategic use of robots.txt
          can enhance crawl efficiency, potentially speeding up indexation.
          Careful implementation and testing are crucial to leverage robots.txt
          effectively for improved SEO and better control over search engine
          crawlers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve SEO with robots.txt, you can use specific directives to
          guide search engine crawlers effectively. Here are some common
          instructions to include in your robots.txt file:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><p>1. Allow All Crawlers: To ensure search engines can access all parts of your website, include this line: "User-agent: *".</p></li>
          <li><p>2. Disallow Specific Directories: To prevent indexing of irrelevant or duplicate content, use "Disallow" to block specific directories you don't want crawlers to access.</p></li>
          <li><p>3. Crawl Delay: You can set "Crawl-delay" to control how fast search engines crawl your site, reducing server load for better performance.</p></li>
          <li><p>4. Sitemap Location: Indicate the location of your XML sitemap using "Sitemap" to help crawlers find and index your pages more efficiently.</p></li>
        </ol>

          <img
            src="../assets/SVG/expandMore.svg"
            alt="Carrot expand / collapse" />What is .htaccess File Used for ?
        </h3>
        <article id="section1" style="display: none">
          <p>
            The .htaccess file is a powerful configuration file used on web
            servers running Apache HTTP Server software. Its primary purpose is
            to provide per-directory or per-file-based configuration, allowing
            website administrators to override default server settings without
            modifying the main server configuration file (httpd.conf). This
            flexibility makes it useful, especially in shared hosting
            environments where users have limited access to server
            configurations.
          </p>
          <div class="flex">
            <div>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    1. URL Rewriting and Redirection: One of the most common
                    uses of .htaccess is to rewrite URLs and set up redirects.
                    This enables website owners to create user-friendly and
                    SEO-friendly URLs or redirect old URLs to new ones. For
                    example, you can convert example.com/product.php?id=123 into
                    example.com/product/123/, making it more readable and search
                    engine-friendly.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    2. Access Control: .htaccess allows administrators to
                    control access to specific directories or files based on
                    various criteria, such as IP addresses, user authentication,
                    or specific HTTP headers. This feature is valuable for
                    restricting access to sensitive areas of a website or
                    protecting files from unauthorized access.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    3. Custom Error Pages: Website owners can define custom
                    error pages using .htaccess. When a visitor encounters an
                    error, such as a 404 Page Not Found, the server displays a
                    custom-designed error page instead of the default one. This
                    helps maintain a consistent branding and user experience
                    across the site.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    4. MIME Type and File Handling: .htaccess can be used to
                    specify how the server handles different file types. This
                    includes setting appropriate MIME types for files, which
                    informs the browser how to handle specific file formats.
                    Proper MIME types are essential for ensuring correct
                    rendering of files, such as images, videos, or downloadable
                    content.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    5. Caching and Compression: Using .htaccess, administrators
                    can control caching settings and enable compression for
                    files served by the server. Caching reduces server load and
                    improves website performance, while compression reduces the
                    size of files transmitted over the network, leading to
                    faster loading times for visitors.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    6. Security Enhancements: Various security-related
                    configurations can be implemented through .htaccess, such as
                    preventing directory browsing, blocking specific IP
                    addresses or user agents known for malicious activities, and
                    enabling SSL/TLS for secure connections.
